	Title: Comparative Evaluations of Selected Tracking-by-Detection Approaches.
	Authors: A. A. Mekonnen and F. Lerasle
	
	<p>
		<i>Abstract:</i> In this work, we present a comparative evaluation of various multi-person tracking-by-detection approaches on public
		datasets. The work investigates popular sequential Monte Carlo and template ensemble based trackers coupled with relevant visual people 
		detectors with emphasis on exhibited performance variation depending on tracker-detector choices. Our experimental results show that tracking is sensitive to the detector choice
		and should be done after careful evaluation. Even a 1% difference in detector recall could lead to a 10% drop in tracking accuracy.
